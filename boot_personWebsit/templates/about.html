                        <p>Thank you for visiting my personal website. Your presence here means a lot to me, and I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to explore it. My hope is that you find enjoyment and value in your visit.</p>
                        <p>Allow me to introduce myself: I'm Pratik Thapa, though most people simply refer to me as 'P,' a nickname I've grown rather fond of.</p>
                        <p>Currently, I'm pursuing my undergraduate degree in computer science at NCSU. Coding is not just a passion for me; it's a love affair. Surprisingly, I've found that my other love, working out, plays an unexpectedly significant role in my coding journey. It may sound peculiar, but hear me out. Engaging in physical exercise has proven to be a powerful aid in my coding endeavors. It clears my mind, enhances my focus, and cultivates patienceâ€”an invaluable asset in the world of programming.</p>
                        <p>Once again, thank you for stopping by. I hope you enjoy your time here as much as I enjoy sharing my world with you.</p>
